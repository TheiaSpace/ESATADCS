* Changes in ESATADCS 3.4.0, 2019-07-24

** The wait at the end of the wheel calibration sequence is longer
to ensure that the calibration sequence finishes.

** There is a new telecommand for resetting the wheel controller.

** There is a new telecommand for gyroscope bias correction.

** There is a new telecommand for magnetometer geometry correction.

** There is a new telecommand for gyroscope reconfiguration.


* Changes in ESATADCS 3.3.2, 2019-02-26

** A crash on reading the gyroscope or the magnetometer before
configuring/beginning them has been fixed.


* Changes in ESATADCS 3.3.1, 2019-02-07

** The time between 16-octet chunks written to the EPS has been raised
to 1 ms.

** In order to filter wheel-induced vibrations, the low-pass filter of
the gyroscope is now active with a bandwidth of 5 Hz.

** An error in the calculation of the derivative correction of the
wheel PID controller has been fixed.


* Changes in ESATADCS 3.3.0, 2018-11-16

** ESAT_ADCS keeps its own time for telemetry packets.

** There is a new telecommand for setting the time.


* Changes in ESATADCS 3.2.0, 2018-10-24

** All computer code files have copyright notices.

** There is a new main program.

** The main ADCS library module has new methods needed by the main
ADCS program.

** The ADCS can run in the new STM32L4-based ADCS board as well as running
in the OBC board.

** When running in the STM32L4-based ADCS board, the ADCS acts as an
I2C slave that receives telecommands from the OBC and sends telemetry
to the OBC.

** The minimum required version of the Arduino core for the ADCS board
(Theia Space's ESAT Boards (STM32L4)) is 1.0.0.

** The minimum required version of the Arduino core for the OBC board
(Theia Space's ESAT Boards (MSP430)) is 3.0.0.

** The minimum required version of ESATUtil is 2.1.0.


* Changes in ESATADCS 3.1.0, 2017-11-30

** There are new diagnostics telecommands.

** The magnetorquer polarity setting modes of operation have been fixed.

** There is a new detumble mode of operation.

** Some formatting and other style issues have been fixed.


* Changes in ESATADCS 3.0.0, 2017-11-08

** Telemetry and telecommand packets are CCSDS Space Packets.

** The modules have been renamed and distributed into directories.

** Users can define new telemetry packets, telecommand handlers
and modes of operation in the Arduino sketch.

** Packets passed around through the USB interface go in KISS frames.

** The minimum required version of the Arduino core (Theia Space's
ESAT Boards) is 2.0.0.

** The minimum required version of ESATUtil is 2.0.0.


* Changes in ESATADCS 2.2.0, 2017-07-03

** The PID gains have better default values.

** The wheel PID algorithm has a less astonishing form.

** Command names are human-readable now.


* Changes in ESATADCS 2.1.0, 2017-02-17

** Some old status flags are recovered.


* Changes in ESATADCS 2.0.0, 2017-02-09

** The library has been splitted into different modules.

** The minimum required version of the Energia core (Theia Space's
ESAT Boards) is 1.0.0.

** There is a new dependency: ESATUtil 1.0.0.
