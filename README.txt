ESAT ADCS library version 3.3.0.

Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) for ESAT.

This software runs either as the main program in the ESAT ADCS board
(for the newer model with a standalone microprocessor) or as a library
in the ESAT OBC board (for use together with the legacy ESAT ADCS
board controlled by the ESAT OBC board).  Use it with Arduino 1.8.0 or
newer together with:

  * ESAT ADCS board: the Arduino core for STM32L4-based ESAT
    boards (Theia Space's ESAT Boards (STM32L4)) 1.0.0 or a newer 1.x.y
    version and the ESAT utility library (ESATUtil) version 2.1.0 or a
    newer 2.x.y version.  Use ESAT-ADCS as the target board.  In
    addition, program the On-Board Computer with the option ADCS Code
    Running in ADCS (option ADCS=ADCS).

  * ESAT OBC board: the Arduino core for MSP430-based ESAT boards
    (Theia Space's ESAT Boards (MSP430)) 2.2.0 or a newer 2.x.y
    version, the ESAT utility library (ESATUtil) version 2.1.0 or a
    newer 2.x.y version, and the ESAT OBC library (ESATOBC) version
    4.1.0 or a newer 4.x.y version.  Use the example OBC program,
    ESAT-OBC as the target board and the option ADCS Code Running in
    OBC (option ADCS=OBC).

See the example ADCS program (examples/ADCS/ADCS.ino).  This program
uses the modules of the ADCS library.  This program runs in the ADCS
board.

The src/ directory contains the ADCS library, which has a main module
(ESAT_ADCS) as well as helper modules distributed in subdirectories.

There are 5 subdirectories in src/ with the libraries that provide the
detailed ADCS functionality:

  * ESAT_ADCS-actuators: low-level actuator control libraries.

  * ESAT_ADCS-controllers: high-level attitude and actuator control
    libraries.

  * ESAT_ADCS-measurements: libraries for the attitude state vector
    and the sensors that measure the attitude state.

  * ESAT_ADCS-run-modes: libraries that handle the different modes of
    operation of the ADCS.

  * ESAT_ADCS-telecommand-handlers: libraries that handle groups of
    telecommands.

  * ESAT_ADCS-telemetry-packets: library that fill telemetry packets.
