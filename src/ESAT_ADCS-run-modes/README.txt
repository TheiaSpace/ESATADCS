ADCS run modes abstract the modes of operation of the ADCS.


# ESAT_ADCSRunMode

Run modes must implement this interface, which exposes two methods:

  byte identifier();

  void run();

The identifier must be unique for each run mude.

The run() method performs whatever actions are relevant to the run
mode, like running the attitude control loop or simply switching on
and off actuators.

To change the run mode, use ESAT_ADCS.setRunMode()
