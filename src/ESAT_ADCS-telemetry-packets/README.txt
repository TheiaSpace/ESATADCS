ADCS telemetry packets go here.


# ESAT_ADCSTelemetryPacket

Telemetry packets must implement this interface, which exposes two methods:

  byte packetIdentifier();

  void readUserData(ESAT_CCSDSPacket& packet);

ESAT_ADCS keeps a stack of available telemetry packets.  On each ADCS
update cycle, stack the packets that will generated by the next calls
to ESAT_ADCS.readTelemetry() with ESAT_ADCS.addTelemetryPacket().
ESAT_ADCS.readTelemetry() will remove ADCS telemetry packet objects
from the stack and call their readUserData() methods to fill the
user data fields of the packets.
