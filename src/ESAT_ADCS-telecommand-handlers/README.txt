ADCS telecommand handlers provide telecommand responses.  Each
telecommand handler is intended to manage a group of related
telecommands, identified by the packet identifier field of the
secondary header of the telecommand packet.


# ESAT_ADCSTelecommandHandler

Telecommand handlers must implement this interface, which exposes one
method:

  boolean handleTelecommand(ESAT_CCSDSPacket telecommand);

The telecommand handler must identify the telecommand with the
packetIdentifier field of the secondary header (obtained with
telecommand.readSecondaryHeader()) and:

  * if the telecommand handler owns this telecommand, handle it
    and return true;

  * if the telecommand handler doesn't own this telecommand,
    return false.

Telecommand arguments are part of the user data field (the part of the
packet data that comes after the secondary header).

To register a new telecommand handler, use
ESAT_ADCS.registerTelecommandHandler().
